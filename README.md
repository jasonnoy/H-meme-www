Identifying Creative Harmful Memes via Prompt based Approach

Prerequisites: Google drive account access is necessary for downloading the harm dataset.

It is very simple to use our approach to train & apply a harmful meme detection model:
First, use vision-in-text module to generate a caption and a bunch of keywords as mentioned in our paper.
Second, use the h-meme model to train a harmful meme detection model, we used harmful-politics dataset as example, which contains the example we used in the following picture.

You can apply to any image-text dataset, thanks to the applicability of this approach.
